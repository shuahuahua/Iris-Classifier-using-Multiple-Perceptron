## Introduction

This case study is designed to apply fundamental and intermediate Java programming concepts in a practical context. It showcases the use of object-oriented design, data parsing, and automated file generation to produce structured report cards from raw grade data. The final output is a set of .txt files personalized for each student.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a CSV file (bini_grades.csv) containing student names and their respective grades. This data is parsed and processed to compute final grades, evaluate student performance, and generate detailed reports.

## Tools and Libraries

- Java (JDK) - Programming Language
- IntelliJ IDEA - IDE for Project Development
- Standard Java I/O libraries â€“ For reading CSV files and writing text reports

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/JavaCaseStudy.git
   
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or any Java-compatible IDE.
3. Ensure Java SDK is configured properly in your environment.

## Usage

1. Place the bini_grades.csv file inside the root project folder.
2. Run the main class to execute the report generation.
3. Check the Generated Report Cards folder for the output .txt files.

## Results

The project generates a text-based report card for each student, including their name, subject-wise grades, and remarks. These reports are timestamped for reference and organized within the Generated Report Cards directory.
